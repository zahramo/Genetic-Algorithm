    "<li> The fitness must have an accurate estimate of the quality of the solution. Here again, because we want to finally get the order of the gates to print the correct output for all input strings, we take the fitness as the percentage of correct output.\n",
    "Although the fitness function should not only correlate closely with the designer's goal, but it should also be computationally efficient. Speed of execution is very important, as a typical genetic algorithm must be iterated many times in order to produce a usable result for a non-trivial problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " <li> Ranke base selection is used here because in the other one (FPS) when the fitness value of one chromosome is much higher than the next chromosomes, it is much more likely to be selected, which means that some good and helpful genes are not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> N point crossover was used here to implement crossover because we did not want to make too many changes.\n",
    "In general, the crossover algorithm is used to create children by combining two parents who have not been able to get us to the correct answer.\n",
    "And the mutation algorithm is used to change existing genes to other genes in the hope of improving performance. The probability is usually considered a small number so that population converges more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> When the best answer we have in several consecutive loops remains constant, it means that we have reached a state where we do not get a better answer despite the combinations we make, so the initial population is probably not suitable or has not gone well due to the changes. In these cases, we can randomly generate a population again and continue.\n",
    "This is likely to happen, especially here when the best people go direct to the next generation.\n",
    "In other words, from one place to another, more people in population become like each other while they are far from the right answer(local max). So with a small change, the genes do not get better, and it is best to change population."
